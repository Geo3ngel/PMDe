The map editor can be used to edit the coordinates of dungeons on the map. A point is selected when clicked and it can be edited by changing the numbers.


#Credits
Huge thanks to **BRNMan** and **Crocodile91** who have documented a lot of the game's data and ROM structure. This project also uses some icons from **Pretty Office Icon Set Part 7**.
